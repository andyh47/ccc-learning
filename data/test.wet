Life is calling
December 20, 2012 Sandra	23 Comments
I’m always surprised when I bump into one of you, just going about my business, always surprised when you recognise me, come and say hello. It’s just me, why on earth would you be interested in anything I have to say? And yet you constantly come back and remind me to speak up, to speak clearly. Don’t be quiet, you remind me. You have a voice.
Here we are at the end of this year, my last post before I take a month’s break and the rest of the country goes on holiday, a post in which I try to sum up the latest stage of the wild roller coaster ride that has been my blogging life.
It has in fact been a year of letting go.
This has been in some ways the very best and the hardest of years: A year in which I achieved a triumph few writers ever achieve; a year in which penury and rootlessness also featured prominently. A year in which I finally set down roots deep in a town I have grown to love deeply, passionately.
Those of you who have followed this blog from the outset have always expressed amazement that my life has taken so many twists and turns. To you I would say you don’t know the half of it. So much of my life is withheld from you all. You don’t see too many photos of my children and that’s the way I like it. You don’t know my extended family at all and that’s the way we all like it.
Like all of you, I have my own grand themes that run through my life: triumph and joy, soul-destroying tragedy, illness, failure, heartbreak, ostracism and whooping hollering joy, love, happy dances and small victories. These large themes have dominated most of the last decade of my life as I’ve slowly unravelled all the cords and links and binds that kept me small and afraid. It’s been a monumental transition and not at all easy. What a life.
But mostly this year, while it didn’t go away completely, the white noise of upheaval and failure has abated. The tide turned when I finally gave voice to my anger and told the critics to shut the hell up. I stood up and spoke up, even though my voice was very shaky. It was a post that garnered more comments, both here and elsewhere than at any times since that awful newspaper story of two years ago. It gave me enormous comfort to know I was not always on my own, no matter the circumstances. Very quietly, the creeping realisation came to me that this was it, and while it isn’t a perfect life, it is the life I have chosen for myself.
I’ve taken a few backward steps since then, not because I failed but because I needed to get a little more closely aligned to what I really want from life. While on the surface it looks disastrous – living with yet another housemate, still paying down debt, no extras or extravagances – my life is now quietly optimistic, even if my ambitions are still yet to come to fruition. I have optimism and strength but most of all I have self-belief.
At long last, I’m no longer at war with myself.
This year has given me the gift of friendship, from establishing networks and forming business contacts to genuine girlie nights out and blogger gatherings, dinner parties with friends and even some honest to goodness old-fashioned dates.
And in the midst of it all is the town itself. I always knew Melbourne was the right place for me to live, but I never knew quite how much it resonated with me until this year. It’s provided the background from which I could at long last find my tribe. And yes, that means talking, thinking, left-leaning, feminist, coffee-swilling, food-obsessed, creative types. At long last I feel I belong, that I’m not an outsider.
From this assurance has grown the ability and self-belief to express myself in ways I could only dream of a few years ago. I’m a better cook and writer than I was when I began, but somehow I’ve become a shinier, smarter, more forgiving version of myself at the same time.
Next year sees a new blog design, some new business ventures and adventures and a gentle changing of a few habits and behaviours. Now that the changes I’ve sought are so close to hand, I’m as nervous as hell, but I don’t have any reason to stop. I constantly ask myself not if, but when.
At long last, that cruel decade is over and life is calling. But first, I’m going to have a couple of quiet G & Ts.
Have a wonderful Christmas with your loved ones and if you are lucky enough to get one, enjoy your holidays.
I’ll be back here, bright-eyed and ready for work, on Monday 21st January.
In the meantime, drop in to my Facebook page or catch up with me on Twitter. It might be sporadic, but I will be around.

I’ve thoroughly enjoyed all of the above in 2012 and look forward to 2013. I’ll be thinking of you at Christmas as we tuck into your Prawns with Lime Chilli Dipping Sauce and Honey and Orange Glazed Ham (to name a few). I’ve really enjoyed your Christmas series and have printed them all out for next year! Merry Christmas to you and yours, and I hope 2013 is even better x
Reply	Sandra says:	December 21, 2012 at 12:10 pm	Sounds like a wonderful Festivus of Feasting. Take care, see you in 2013 x
Reply	Ros says:	December 20, 2012 at 7:44 am	Enjoy your christmas break and enjoy life. I look forward to reading next year’s posts.
Reply	Sandra says:	December 21, 2012 at 12:10 pm	Thanks Ros x
Reply	Jay - The Moodie Foodie says:	December 20, 2012 at 7:53 am	Great post Sandra. I too look forward to 2013 with some changes and not just a little nervousness:) I’ve only been blogging for a year and have found it nerve-wracking, frustrating, lonely but also cathartic, rewarding and incredibly exciting. As for Melbourne. I’ve been here for only 7 short years and I love it. LOVE IT! Is there any other town you’d prefer to live in? I find it difficult to think of one. I’m so glad you’ve found your path and your tribe and I wish you nothing but success in 2013. Merry Christmas Sandra and Amazing New Year xo
Reply	Sandra says:	December 21, 2012 at 12:12 pm	Cathartic and rewarding. I get it. As for Melbourne, I can’t think of any other place I’d live in. x
Reply	The Life of Clare says:	December 20, 2012 at 8:07 am	Enjoy your well deserved break! Wishing your family a safe and festive silly season!
Reply	Sandra says:	December 21, 2012 at 12:13 pm	Thanks Clare for all your support through the year. See you in 2013 x
Reply	Judy says:	December 20, 2012 at 8:35 am	A very Merry Christmas to you too, Sandra. I wish you all the very best in life and love (you thought you could slip in that bit about going out on dates and no one would notice? Ha!), but most of all, I wish you peace. And a fabulous 2013!
Reply	Sandra says:	December 21, 2012 at 12:15 pm	There’s always one person who notices everything Judy. I’m just dipping my toes in, surprisingly, the dating waters seem remarkably calm and inviting. All the best, see you in 2013
Reply	karynp says:	December 20, 2012 at 9:49 am	Sandra, Have a safe and peaceful Christmas, you deserve all that you have been gifted. I look forward to the new look blog. You have motivated me to start my own blog, enjoying the freedom to write about life and other musings. I will raise a glass of my favourite S.A bubbly to your health and happiness. Karyn
Reply	Sandra says:	December 21, 2012 at 12:17 pm	Of all the people who could write online, I’m so glad you are doing so. A peaceful and joyous Christmas to you and your family Karyn. Still haven’t forgotten your invitation to come visit one day.
Reply	Christine says:	December 20, 2012 at 8:39 pm	That took a lot of guts to say what you had to say. I read the other blog post that you linked, the one with the haters and I’m truly amazed at how ugly people can be to others they barely know. I’m glad you decided to keep walking. This year we went from two incomes to one so I’m glad I discovered your blog via the lamb shoulder recipe in NQN. You have inspired me to try and still cook well on a limited budget. Your wonderful recipes have featured regularly on our menus and the tuna pasta bake is our baby’s favourite. Our Christmas Eve dinner will have your roast vegetables gratin and raspberry semi freddo. And I have so many of your recipes bookmarked and kept in Evernote for future cooking, testing and deliciousness. Here’s to bigger and better things for you in 2013!
Reply	Sandra says:	December 21, 2012 at 12:19 pm	Thank you Christine. Have a wonderful Christmas and I’m sure the food will be a wonderful centrepiece to a great family day. All the best x
Reply	Trish says:	December 21, 2012 at 2:12 pm	I pop over to read your blog fairly regularly, I don’t read too many but your’s is on my loop. I really enjoy your recipes and stories. I use your chilli-con -carne recipe and it is great(who’d have thought coffee and cocoa would make a difference?). Keep up the great blogging and have a well earned break.
Reply	Rosemary McKenzie-Ferguson says:	December 22, 2012 at 9:39 am	Hi Sandra it has indeed been a most amazing year, a year when it first started I had no clear idea as to what it looked like let alone what was to come.
This year saw the “Bags of Love” emergency food project find a home of its own, we nicknamed the kitchen “Julies Kitchen” because none of us would dare do anything in there without first checking with Julie if she is happy with what we are doing ~Julie always says yes, but it is polite to ask~
{“Bags of Love” emergency food project is for injured workers and their familes who need help with the family food budget.}
There are drawing board plans to develope “Bags of Love” as a stand alone label with the funds raised going back into the “Bags of Love” emergency food project.
This year also has seen me re-establish a veggie garden and add chooks just for the sheer pleasure of having their company with the bonus of fresh eggs.
I dropped the not so gentle hint that for Christmas I wanted “Sustainable Food” by Michael Mobbs http://sustainablehouse.com.au/ The reason for the renewed interest in veggie gardens is simple, the “Bags of Love” emergency food project needs to feed a lot of people, so it is important that I learn how to grow the maximum amout of veggies in the smallest of areas.
When I let the chooks out this morning I noticed that my lime tree has fruit on it some of them the size of marbles, reason for my excitement is I have never grown any citrus trees before so to have a lime tree growing and looking healthy as well is just amazing to me.
Thank you Sandra for all your amazing work I am sorry we didn’t get to catch up this year when you were in Adelaide, mayhaps we can work our schedules better next year.
Have a wondrous holiday, I hope that Santa is very good to you.
Merry Christmas everyone.
Yours in service
Rosemary
Reply	karen stooke says:	December 24, 2012 at 7:39 pm	Beautiflly written Sandra……whilst l have not met you, we have mutual friends, and like quite a few of our old blogging pals have followed your year with interest……merry christmas and have a lovely break…..hopefully we can meet up in 2013….xx
Reply	Adelaide Wilson says:	December 27, 2012 at 7:42 pm	About 40 years ago my husband and I and our 6 children spent 10 years in an organisation with no guaranteed income. I learned many things including how to cook suet puddings, lamb necks, ox tongues, lots of cabbage etc. It was a challenging time and painful often but a valuable experience that stays with me and frees me from many fears even now. Much fellow feeling, Adelaide
Reply	Katherine says:	December 29, 2012 at 10:25 pm	Thanks Sandra for another year of super recipes and stories. You’ve certainly copped a lot, and I admire your guts and tenacity. It’s great to hear that you have come through it stronger and hopefully more content. I wish you all the best for for the new year, and look forward to reading your posts in 2013.
Reply	Veronica Moran says:	January 7, 2013 at 9:51 pm	I love the way you write. emotional and reflective. your reference to ”white noise” strikes a chord with me. May the New Year bring happiness to you cheers Veronica
Reply	Janine says:	January 23, 2013 at 10:54 am	HI Sandra, I just read this blog as I was overseas visiting Europe for the first time ever, and I would like to say thanks for sharing what you do with us, your recipes are great, and I’m going to purchase your book on the weekend as my trip to Europe kinda blew out my budget a little and has also whetted my appetite for more travel now that all 4 of my kids are grown and moving out. So now the next stage of life begins like saving and cutting back on certain things, except for books and quilting fabric!!! And to do that I know I need to organise my food shopping better as I find that I end up chucking out heaps and i am so fed up with the waste of it. So Big W here I come to purchase your book and follow the guidelines.
I hope you had a great Christmas/New Year I know my two youngest daughters and I did, we were in Rome and Paris, and what a fantastic time we had together.
Thanks again Janine

The second dumbest part is that USC considers this "tradition". I think it would be great if Bama could get away with urinating on opposing player's mascots before every game, but I don't think I could argue it was "tradition" if they made us stop.
I don't see how anyone can make the "tradition" argument with a straight face.

I see your point but they're not killing the field or anything. Renegade and Osceola do it and the horse poops at the 20 before every game. Clean it up and play ball.

We aren't talking about sustaining a block, just make him trip over you. If the Lions can leave Jahvid Best in to block on passing downs and not consider it a major liability then I suppose I should have a decent chance at a 10% success ratio.

The only chance I would have is if I had Cam or Vick as my quarter back and he is 7 yds deep in a shotgun and takes off at the snap 180 degrees away from Peppers. I would be able to give Cam a 1/2 second head start, then about 15 minutes to recover while they scrape me off the field. weagle89 ● 5 stars Rating: 92248 votes total Freshman (469) 30 months Send Message Follow User Ignore User Reply Quote Rate Up Rate Down 3 years ago MKatUmich said...

Peppers tripping over you isn't going to take 3 seconds. Even if you chop him down (which, you're not doing) I'd still put money on him getting to the QB before 3 seconds is up.

Fabian Nunez has healthcare activists arrested at California Capitol? | 24Ahead
24Ahead.com: Immigration and Politics
Take action now:Search for those who talk with @McQandO, ask if they too support amnesty
Search for those who talk with @JaredPolis, show them how Jared Polis deceives
Search for those who talk with @PeterEisner and NewsHour, point out what they don't understand about skilled immigration
Fabian Nunez has healthcare activists arrested at California Capitol? I haven't researched this, but Jamie Court of the "Foundation For Taxpayer and Consumer Rights" (and founder of an anti-Arnold Schwarzenegger site) says:
Even I was shocked to hear that California Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez directed the California Highway Patrol to prevent our consumer group and an uninsured Massachusetts teacher from speaking out inside the Capitol against mandatory health insurance. The Capitol's famous rotunda is routinely used for press conferences by lobbyists and politicians...
Though they complied with the California Highway Patrol's order to leave the building, my colleagues Jerry Flanagan and Carmen Balber were later informed they are being written up for misdemeanors. They were also told our consumer group would not be able to speak to the press in the rotunda in the future. Nunez and the CHP will be hearing from our lawyers soon...
UPDATE: Nunez spokesman Steven Maviglio - or at least someone using his name - posts in comments an alternative view of the incident. This doesn't appear to have been covered by the MSM, and no video is provided by Jamie Court. Possibly related:

La Ligue nationale de hockey aurait soumis une nouvelle offre à l’Association des joueurs, selon Pierre Lebrun (ESPN).
Les détails de cette autre offre de la LNH ne sont pas connus pour le moment, mais soyez à l’affût des derniers développements par rapport à ce dossier. Cette offre pourrait être la bonne.
Les deux clans doivent s’entendre d’ici le 14 janvier prochain, sinon la saison 2012-2013 sera complètement annulée.
Permettez-moi d’être très optimiste avec cette offre déposée par la LNH jeudi dernier. Plusieurs matchs de la LNH pourraient débuter d’ici deux ou trois semaines.

We had SO much fun in Sacramento this weekend and we're grateful to David and Susan for extending the invitation to us to join their travel group's reunion picnic. The China adoption community is a wonderfully warm place and the people we met (or met again) this weekend are some of the nicest we've had the pleasure to know! And could the kids be any more adorable? Seriously, the park, the weather, the food, the friendly conversation -- it couldn't possibly have been better.

2 Political Junkies: Yea, This Needs To Be Moved.
We are the 99%
March 22, 2012
Yea, This Needs To Be Moved.
Posted by
Dayvoe
(H/t to our friends at Steel City Skeptics):
(Full sized image can be seen here.)
This monument stands at the main entrance of a local public high school. It needs to be moved.
According to a letter sent to George Batterson, Superintendent of the New Kensington-Arnold School District by the Freedom From Religion Foundation:
This monument was brought to our attention by a local student who witnessed the monument when visiting Valley High School. FFRF is a national nonprofit organization with 17,500 members across the country, including nearly 600 members in Pennsylvania. Our purpose is to protect the constitutional principle of separation between state and church.
It is our information and understanding that a large granite monument of the Ten Commandments is prominently displayed at Valley High School. It is our further understanding that this monument sits between two footpath bridges that lead from the parking lot over a small stream to the main entrance of the school. Because of the numbering and missing commandment against "graven images," the monument contains a historically Roman Catholic version of the Ten Commandments.
So not only are non-Christian students marginalized by the monument, non-Catholic students are marginalized as well.
I'll try to be as clear as possible. We live in a secular society. The guv'ment has no authority to impose one religion over another religion over non-religion.
This is clearly what's been going in in New Kensington and it has to stop. Religious liberty is at stake.

There is also a Ten Commandments monument on county owned land in South Park.

You wonder what the administrators were thinking when they put it up. Whatever the reason, let's hope that the situation gets corrected soon and that the monument is removed from school grounds.

Should have been removed immediately. I wouldn't be surprised if someone just removes it themselves.

Un nouveau quartier ouvert, sans limites : explorez le quartier librement
Vos Sims peuvent se promener dans leur quartier, rendre visite � leurs voisins chez eux et explorer les environs. Ils peuvent se rendre au centre-ville � pieds pour y retrouver des amis, faire de nouvelles rencontres au parc ou croiser des coll�gues dans la rue. Si vos Sims sont au bon endroit au bon moment, qui sait ce qui peut arriver ?

Paper Towel Tube Craft: Crowns
Day 1
Decorate paper towel tube. We used tissue paper, glue & glitter. Let Dry.
Day 2
Flatten tube. Make slits in tube, alternating sides approximately a half inch apart. Make sure you don't cut all the way across.
Puff up tube again. Slowly fold back rings. They will alternate as you go.
Pretty cool! But don't stop there!
Measure around child's head with garland. Trim and tape into crown. Give to child to decorate. Pom poms, feathers, gems, sequins and lots of glue. Let dry.
Just beautiful!
The girls want to do this again but use the garlands to decorate the doorways for Halloween. So we are saving our paper towel tubes! Enjoy crafting with your kids ;-) Mama King

Recycled Kids Craft: Apples
Pin It
I'm back! Although summer is still here I have Fall on the brain. Fall is my favorite time of year.
This is an easy craft, especially for all those Pre-K and K classes out there starting off the school year with an A theme. These are so easy to make and would make a great class Apple Tree display.
Supplies: clear glue, paint brush, clear plastic lids, hole punch, white, red or green tissue paper, stem with leaves (or use a brown pipe cleaner and green tissue paper cut into a leaf shape), apple seeds (or brown paper cut into seed shapes)
Day 1
Glue seed to inside of lid. Looks like a petri dish. Have kids arrange seeds using a toothpick.Let dry overnight.
Adult prep: Determine top of apple and punch hole as far away from outside edge as possible. Day 2
Rip tissue paper into small pieces.Glue white tissue paper on inside of lid. Overlap paper for good coverage. Easiest method. Squirt glue all over lid. Spread it with a paint brush. Lay pieces of tissue on top. Brush with a bit more glue on top. This way fingers should stay clean.
Rip green or red tissue into thin strips. Add glue around inside edge. Place tissue down and using the paint brush - gently push and coax paper into place. Children will need an adult to demonstrate how to do this. It doesn't need to be perfect. It actually looks better the less precise it is. Let dry.
Adult prep: Glue stems into holes. A glue gun is probably the fastest. Older kids can glue the stem into place when gluing the tissue on by laying pieces of tissue over stem like bandages to secure.
They make great sun catchers too! Tie a thread or ribbon through the hole so kids can hang them from a window.

Aluminum Foil Bookmarks
Em's Mermaid & Lu's Fairy
Our first official craft project in the new home is actually an old project. Last winter we made a mermaid bookmark utilizing this same technique. Lu found her mermaid bookmark in one of the many boxes marked "miscellaneous"still left to unpack. She begged to make a new one. Feeling guilty for subjecting the girls to an afternoon of watching me unpack, I tore open a couple of craft boxes and found all the materials needed. Supplies: Scissors, Aluminum Foil, Contact Paper, Permanent MarkersOptional: Glitter and Tissue Paper
Have child draw picture on piece of aluminum foil. Trim design if desired. Cut 2 pieces of contact paper to size. one for the front and one for the back. Make sure there is enough room along edges to create a seal. Peel off backing of contact paper. Add glitter and tissue if desired. Place aluminum foil picture face down onto contact paper. Place a second piece of contact paper on back. Smooth and make sure edges are sealed shut. Trim if desired.
Kids can create a two sided book mark by drawing a picture on the other side. Older kids could illustrate two main characters from a favorite story, one on each side.

Thank You!
We are still here! Managing to have fun in the midst of unpacking and painting. I built this makeshift house for the girls to play in. Hopefully there aren't any big bad wolves in the neighborhood.
Thank you for all of your kind words and support. I miss blogging and reading all your wonderful blogs! I can't wait to catch up on all your blogs. Just a giant cup of coffee and some ME time. A girl can dream can't she? Until then...
Check out Part One and Part Two of our 3 Little Pigs post if you've got a minute.

5B4: Worldview by Leonard Freed

Worldview by Leonard Freed
Leonard Freed’s last words to his wife before succumbing to cancer on November 30, 2006 were “No more pictures.” Freed, who was 77 when he died, was organizing an exhibition and book for the Musee de l’Elysee in Laussanne of his life’s work. Worldview, both in book and show is the most comprehensive retrospective of this accomplished photographer to date. Leonard Freed was a mix of many different types of photographers. There was Freed who could work a news event as fluidly and professionally as any other spot news photographer. There was also the Freed whose interest could be sparked to a subject so strongly that he wouldn’t stop his in depth exploration until there was a full “story” under his belt. “You can recognize everything from then on is redundant and there is no need to do any more.” And then, most interesting to me, there was the Leonard Freed who was a wanderer, fascinated with everyday occurrence and happenstance. The book Worldview published by Steidl in association with the Musee de l’Elysee is a 300+ page, 200 image compilation of Freed’s best work. Designed with the work presented chronologically, the book reveals a surprising consistency from Freed’s earliest pictures to his last. Freed once said, “Good photographers are born not made.” I know a few that weren’t, but Freed seems to be a fine example of talent from the start. The edit of Worldview is a wonderful mix of known and unknown images. Even for those familiar with his work, the variety of the edit is a refreshing and enlightening walk through the 50 plus years of Freed’s career. Worldview isn’t without slight flaws in design and printing but they are not enough to detract strongly from the overall enjoyment of the work. The design aspect is my usual criticism of some images getting dissected by the gutter of the book (this doesn’t seem to be problematic for most people only me). Luckily, the book is bound in a way that opens very flat; surprising because this is a very thick book. The printing is another matter. You have heard me say (and I continue to like a bleating sheep) that Steidl is the best printer (and possibly publisher) of current photo and art books. So it was a surprise to see that this book in my opinion has some printing problems in several of the images. In those images the tonalities reminded me of the grayness that one can experience while making gelatin silver prints from copy negatives. It was after I read the production credits in the back of the book that I found a curious one for “Original prints photographed by Nicholas Lieber.” So the original prints were rephotographed and then those (digital?) images were prepared for the press? This is distinctly different from scanning prints or negatives which is the usual process. I think this ‘rephotographing’ accounts for the lack of shadow detail in many of the images and the grayness I referred to before. Usually Steidl is capable of very smooth transitions between tones and the achievement of an extended tonal range but here the scale is compressed; especially in the lower darker tonalities. I wonder if it was a question of time that led to this mode of production, since after all, it is a companion to the exhibition so there probably was a matter of strict deadlines. Worldview includes an essay by Wim van Sinderen called ‘An American in Amsterdam’ and an interview with between Leonard Freed and Nathalie Herschdorfer that reveals in Freed’s own eloquent words, his approach to photography and his subjects. This is the finest book of Freed’s work available and it trumps the last retrospective book Leonard Freed: Photographs 1954 – 1990 that was published in 1991 by Editions Nathan in Paris and by WW Norton in 1992. That title, although fairly nicely printed, is dull in comparison to this design and selection of images. It also features one of Freed’s lesser interesting images on its cover of a policeman holding a policeman puppet. That particular image, in my opinion, is less indicative of Freed’s usual sensibility and its choice of high placement for the cover seems confused. The cover image of Worldview is of a crowd in Cologne jostling for a clear view of a parade during carnival. This serves a much more fitting and appropriate image for a book from a photographer who spent his life fighting for the best place to stand and see. Freed always struck this viewer as a European photographer posing as an American. His approach seemed to rest somewhere between a European sensibility and an American one. Favoring the lyric over the hard fact, his images even in the grittiest of images, celebrate grace. And while looking through Worldview, grace seems ever present. “Photography is not entertaining, this is not decoration, this is not advertising. Photography is an emotional thing, a graceful thing. Photography allows me to wander with a purpose.” -Leonard FreedBuy online at Steidlville

The design aspect is my usual criticism of some images getting dissected by the gutter of the book (this doesn’t seem to be problematic for most people only me).You are not alone!I've been known to choose not to buy a book because of this. It is endemic though. I was horrified, for example, to see gutter prints in Shore's new edition of 'The Nature of Photographs'.

Colin,It happens all the time but out of my friends I seem to be the only one that goes ballistic over stuff like this. Glad to hear there are others. I'm going to start a support group.

Photos in the gutter do not horrify me categorically. There is a way that it can be done intelligently (be selecting which pictures to run across the gutter, by placement of the gutter and by printing so no image is lost there) but it is often done ineptly and then I am appalled like you. Does the text say how much involvement in the editing and design of the book Leonard had before his demise? He was a terrific photographer and a wonderful person who deserves a major monograph worthy of his stature. I look forward to seeing it.

Stuart,The introduction by William Ewing mentions that Leonard was very hands on with both the book and exhibition. He lived to see their final edit for both show and book but did not live to see either in finished form. The show is apparently of vintage prints. He is mentioned to be "too much of a book person," so to him the book was more important than the exhibition.

The book design is credited to Sarah Winter / Steidl Design. I don't know if that means Sarah AND Steidl or Sarah OF Steidl Design.

Yes, oh my god, photo in the gutter. I am absolutely appalled that a photographer would allow that to happen to his/her work. I just got a book by an Indonesia photog and JHC!, about 20% of his photos are mutilated by the gutter. What's wrong with occasionally printing in landscape format?

I know I'm in a minority of one here, but actually LIKE double spreads, and have done since I first saw the butterfly at the end of The Hungry Caterpillar. Admittedly this probably has something to do with my mother making the butterfly flap its wings and even then, from age, six months or whatever I would have been when this book was presented to me, it irritated me that the gutter was a quarter of the way down one wing so the butterfly flapped in a maimed kind of way.I probably wouldn't go for a big fold and stitching down the middle as the preferred feature of a gallery print. But I love it when, after all these neat and tidy pictures keeping themselves to themselves, each to a page, you get one that's twice the size spilling out across two pages, it just jumps at you. And there's something exciting about the movement of the page, being able to open the picture out. I like double spreads so much that, even though I generally shoot landscape, being too lazy to turn the camera upright, sometimes I make panoramas just so I can have a double spread in my (landscape) portfolio.

Unless the binding is such that a double spread can lie open flat, which is usually NOT the case - I can't help but consider the loss of an image to this dreaded gutter. I can't believe there are that many people, especially involved w/ photography, who are NOT incensed by this.

I am a little tired of this moaning about the gutter. As I said above, running pictures across the gutter can be done intelligently. Take a look at Henri Cartier-Bresson's 'The Decisive Moment' and tell me that the double-page spreads are not spectacular and the images would be better served by staying out of the gutter. There are many other examples up to the present but that is one of the best classic examples.

Stuart,That's why i was compelled to do The Silence which is one of many books that achieve gutter images that I have no problem with. What does get my goat is when it is entirely motivated by the designers feeling that the momentum of the book suffers if the photos are not occasionally shifted away from a book's established pattern. I am not crazy about the book but look at Sally Mann's Immediate Family. 4 pictures are shoved into the gutter when all the rest are full page with a little border. Why was it necessary for those four (which are ruined by the shifting)?? I often "read" this as the designer leaving their mark on books. Kind of like a dog pissing on a hydrant.

The trick is to have a format that allows image to be moved from one side or other, depending on picture content. RE: sally mann: the gutter is where they belong. No redeming social value.

Stuart,I think there is still a lot of moaning about photos in gutters because, unbelievably, photographers still don't understand how to handle them. They forget that their book will rarely be flat like the layouts on single pieces of paper. As you said, all they have to do is remember to leave room to shift the photos left or right to get them out of the gutter. It's amazing they don't remember to do that after all the disasters they have seen. It's a rare book that has small signatures that allow it to open flat. Just when I think photographers have remembered how to handle the gutter, I get another book with lots of headless subjects or pinheads - lost in the gutter.

Gutters aside, I visited the exhibition last weekend and it was well worth the two hours train ride each way - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! It will end next weekend, so hurry up if you're nearby Lausanne, Switzerland.http://tinyurl.com/2l4aw9Thanks to Jeff for bringing it to my attention.

ps: the exhibition will be next shown in the Fotomuseum Den Haag (06.10.2007-13.01.2008)

I would like to say something about the design of the new Freed book, and the question of guttering. I laid out the book, and it was done very carefully as a sequence of pairs. When the pairing wasn't "perfect", I ran the images alone on a double page. Sometimes the image runs across the gutter, sometimes not--it all depended on the power of the image. When it does run across the gutter, it is intentional. It is absurd to have a rule set in stone. I chose images that (a) would not be compromised by gutttering, and (b) would be enhanced bigger than a single page allows. I lay out books with great attention to these issues, and it is always frustrating to see people with knee-jerk reactions. I fully agree that guttering can kill a picture. But it can also work extremely well. The reaction to our show by the public was quite astonishing. Normally our public seems to react according to age, but this time young and old were deeply moved. We have a visitors' book and the words 'moving' 'fascinating' 'magnificent' etc., were often repeated. William A. Ewing, directorMusee de l'Elysee Lausanne

William,Thank you for your comments and the insight into what went into making Worldview.Admittedly, the discussion of gutter images that befell upon this particular book was a bit untimely as I think the images that cross the gutter were chosen wisely and care was given to minimize the effect. I can think of hundreds of other titles that were laid out in a manner where the designer was just leaving their mark so to speak. This I was not mentioning Worldview as one that fell into this camp.I hope my reactions do not seem knee-jerk as I make these criticisms on a case by case basis. My criticism of gutter images is simply how, when "reading" the book, there are moments when the reader is removed from the direct experience of the photographs. It might be the ringing of a cell phone or any disturbance. Or it might be in the book design. When I am drawn away from an image in those circumstances, I make note of it. I may be overly sensitive.It is a wonderful book and I have heard that the exhibition is fantastic. I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Freed several times (and had the rare pleasure of printing a few of his images years ago) he will be missed greatly. Please keep reading and commenting.

I received a nice note from a person at Steidl that let me know about the printing flaw with Worldview. Seems most of my suspicions were correct. The Musee was having the prints photographed (I assume because they were vintage prints and the Musee wanted to capture the patina of them?) and the first two sets of test shots submitted were lacking shadow and highlight detail so they were refused by the head of the scanning department at Steidl. The last set were better but the same problems had resurfaced when they received the entire lot from the photographer. The green light had to be given to proceed with printing because of the exhibition deadline.My thanks to Steidl for clarifying.

Icy Road Conditions In Northwest Arkansas
Posted on: 7:51 am, November 25, 2013, by Heather Lewis and Katie Kormann, updated on: 12:14pm, November 25, 2013	Share this:FacebookTwitterGooglePinterestLinkedInEmail	Traffic was delayed in several places in Northwest Arkansas Monday morning (Nov. 25) after a wintry mix moved through the area creating icy road conditions.
Arkansas State Police responded to multiple accidents in Northwest Arkansas. Fayetteville police said a 12-vehicle pile-up near exit 67 on Interstate 540 resulted in multiple injuries and left traffic at a standstill during rush hour.
An accident was reported in Johnson on I-540 northbound leaving the bridge impassable, according to Springdale police.
Five vehicles were involved in an accident on I-540 off the Porter Road exit around 6:30 a.m., according to Fayetteville police. Authorities said there were no injuries involved in this accident.
Arkansas State Police said officers responded to nearly a dozen fender benders near the White River Bridge on Arkansas 412. Road crews worked throughout the morning to lay sand and salt on the bridge.
Madison County road workers had to treat some bridges in the southern part of the county. Officials said the Crosses Bridge on Arkansas 16 were reported to be icy this morning.

Dana House says:	November 25, 2013 at 8:57 am	Let me get this straight; Washington and Benton counties don’t have slick bridges or roads and aren’t treating their roads with sand/salt, however, there have been numerous serious, injury accidents and a bridge on 540 in Johnson has been deemed “impassable”. Okay, just keep surveying. Carry on…

Kiss it Goodbye! Pirates Win 1960 World Series
Posted on December 16, 2010 by David Kaleida	Like many Pirate fans I was excited when it was announced that the previously thought lost footage of game seven of the 1960 World Series would be aired this winter. As I always do for any major Pittsburgh related sports event I got together with my dad to watch the rebroadcast. Dad was 13 at the time of the game and had listened to most of it on a transistor radio while at school that day. It was a treat that we could both watch this for the first time.
Some highlights:
Early in the game
Dad (trying to be a wiseguy): “Hey look, no DH.”
Me (trying to out-wiseguy him): “Of course. Its in a National League Park.”
Dad : “There sure is a lot of bunting.”
As Joe Christopher pinch runs for Smokey Burgess in the bottom of the 7th
Dad : “He’s from the Virgin Islands. Really fast.”
Mel Allen half a second later repeats this almost verbatim.
Dad : “I wrote Mel Allen’s script.”
Also great was hearing him call out the nicknames of the old players: “There’s Quail!” “They call him Moose.”
Knowing what to expect didn’t make it any less exciting. We cheered when Maz won it.
Even for a winner-takes-all, last-game-for-the-championship the amount of over managing was absurd. This morning as I read through my twitter feed from last night it was like watching it all over again with a group of friends. Plus, thanks to Paul Lukas at UniWatch, I was linked to some great photos and illustrations of the 1960 Pirates.
I’m sure you all enjoyed the show as much as my dad and I did. Now let’s hope the current crew can make this happen again as soon as possible.
